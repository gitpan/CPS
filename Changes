Revision history for CPS

0.03    BUGFIXES:
         * Declare dependency on at least perl 5.8 since weaken() fails tests on
           earlier perls

0.02    CHANGES:
         * Use Scalar::Util::weaken() in kwhile(), breaking cycle for $iter
           and allowing body to care less about leaks. Also allows passthrough
           of $k without intermediate sub{}

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
